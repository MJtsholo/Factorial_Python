Factorial_Python project

Created a programme that produces a factor of a number inserted(input) by the user.

Steps:

    Think about which tests you want to do to test that the factorial function works.
    Write the tests first (before creating the function).
    Test an empty function called factorial - it should fail the tests
    Add code for returning the factorial of a number - it should pass for numbers >= 1
    Add code for dealing with zero - should pass unit test for zero and for numbers >= 1
    Add code for dealing with negative numbers
    Add code for dealing with non-numeric input
